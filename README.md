SmartPub is a CLI tool for Flutter & Dart projects that helps you **identify unused dependencies** and **organize your `pubspec.yaml`** in a clean, predictable way.

Over time, Flutter projects often accumulate unused or poorly organized packages. SmartPub makes it easy to **preview**, **clean**, and **categorize** dependencies without risking accidental changes.

---

## 🤔 Why SmartPub?

In real Flutter projects:

* Unused packages increase build time and maintenance cost
* `pubspec.yaml` becomes hard to read as dependencies grow
* Developers hesitate to clean dependencies due to fear of breaking the app

SmartPub solves this by:

* Detecting unused dependencies safely
* Providing **preview-first** workflows
* Offering **interactive modes** before making changes
* Keeping actions explicit and predictable

No magic. No hidden behavior.

---

## ✨ What SmartPub Does

SmartPub focuses on **two core features only**:

### 1️⃣ Unused Dependency Detection

* Scans your project source code
* Detects unused dependencies
* Allows preview before removal
* Supports interactive confirmation

### 2️⃣ Dependency Categorization ``` (beta) ```
#### [```Powered by FlutterGems```](https://fluttergems.dev/)

* Groups dependencies into logical categories
* Uses known ecosystem data
* Supports preview, auto-apply, and interactive overrides

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Global installation (recommended)

```bash
dart pub global activate smartpub
```

Make sure Dart’s global bin is in your PATH.

---

## 🧭 Usage Overview

```bash
smartpub [command] [options]
```

If no command is provided, SmartPub runs in **preview mode**.

---

## 🔍 Commands

### `check` (default)

Preview unused dependencies (read-only).

```bash
smartpub
smartpub check
```

✔ No files are modified.

---

### `clean`

Remove unused dependencies.

```bash
smartpub clean
```

#### Interactive cleanup

Review each removal before applying changes.

```bash
smartpub clean --interactive
```

A backup of `pubspec.yaml` is created automatically.

---

### `group`

Preview dependency categorization.

```bash
smartpub group
```

#### Apply categorization automatically

```bash
smartpub group --apply
```

#### Interactive categorization

Override suggested categories interactively.

```bash
smartpub group --interactive
```

This is useful when you want full control over how packages are grouped.

---

### `restore`

Restore `pubspec.yaml` from the last backup.

```bash
smartpub restore
```

---

### `update`

Update SmartPub to the latest version.

```bash
smartpub update
```

---

## ⚙️ Options

```text
--apply          Apply changes automatically
--interactive    Review and confirm changes interactively
--no-color       Disable colored output (CI-friendly)
-h, --help       Show help information
-v, --version    Show version information
```

---

## 🧪 Typical Workflow

A safe and recommended workflow:

```bash
smartpub            # preview unused dependencies
smartpub clean      # remove unused dependencies
smartpub group      # preview categorization
smartpub group --interactive
```

This keeps changes intentional and reviewable.

---

## 🛡️ Safety Guarantees

* SmartPub **never modifies files without intent**
* Preview is the default behavior
* Backups are created before changes
* Interactive mode is available for sensitive operations

---

## 📦 Project Scope (Important)

SmartPub intentionally does **not**:

* Modify versions automatically
* Upgrade or downgrade dependencies
* Guess architectural intent

Its goal is **clarity and cleanliness**, not automation overload.
